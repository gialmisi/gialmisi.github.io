      Title of my PhD thesis: **Enhancing the decision-support capabilities of
      interactive multiobjective optimization with explainability.** The thesis
      was supervised by Prof. Kaisa Miettinen and Dr. Bekir Afsar. In my thesis,
      I explore the concept of explainability, inspired by explainability in
      explainable artificial intelligence, when applied to interactive
      multiobjective optimization methods to better support decision makers.

      I completed my masters specializing in computational science. My master's
      thesis was supervised by Prof. Kaisa Miettinen and Dr. Jussi Hakanen. In
      my thesis, I implemented a new kind of interactive multiojective
      optimization methods, which is able to learn a preference model of a
      decision maker during an interactive process.  I applied belief rule-based
      systems as a machine learning model to learn the preference model of a
      decision maker.

      I completed my bachelor of physics focusing on experimental underground
      physics. My bachelor thesis (written in Finnish) was supervised by Prof.
      Jouni Suhonen. In my thesis, I surveyed the ongoing experiments at the
      LNGS (*Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso*), which study the double
      beta-decay of various nuclei. I also compted the experimental upper limit
      of the neutrino based on the experiments' results.
