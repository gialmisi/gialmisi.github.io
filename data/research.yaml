      I am in charge of one of the three work packages of the project. In the
      work package, I continue to research the concept and application of
      explainable and interactive multiobjective optimization, a topic I
      explored in my doctoral thesis.

      I kept contributing to the DESDEO framework, focusing on the development
      of web-based user interfaces for interactive multiobjective optimization.
      The work led to publications, where the interfaces have been utilized to
      conduct user studies to evaluate the decision-support capabilities of
      various interactive multiobjective optimization methods.  I also
      contributed to studies related to lot-sizing, and researching the semantic
      distances of icons in user interfaces for interactive multiobjective
      optimization methods.

      I contributed to the DESDEO framework, spearheading its re-implementation.
      I focused on the tools to model multiobjective optimization problems, and 
      on implementing scalarization-based interactive multiobjective optimization methods.
