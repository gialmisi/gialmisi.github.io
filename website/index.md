# Giovanni Misitano, PhD
We have all kinds of fancy AI tools that can predict this and that, but are
complete black-boxes for a layman. When it comes to making actual decisions
based on the output of these tools, we lack decision-support and grounds to
justify our solutions. My research can help us make informed and explicable
decisions when multiple conflicting criteria are to be considered without a
clear 'best' solution. I am all about providing support and tools to decision
makers (domain experts) to make the best possible decisions given their
expertise, preferences, and the available data and information. I do not care
much about replacing human decision makers, but I do think we can do a much
better job at supporting decision makers across a plethora of different domains,
without relying on black-boxes.

**Stop guessing and start optimizing—and do it explainably!**

## About me
I am currently employed as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of
Jyväskylä, Finland, in the [Multiobjective Optimization Group](https://optgroup.it.jyu.fi/). I specialize in
methods and tools for multiobjective optimization. These methods can be applied
anywhere where data is available, there are conflicting objectives to be
optimized, and there are decision makers with relevant domain expertise.  That
is, pretty much anywhere these days! My current work focuses on researching
decision support tools, more specifically, interactive multiobjective
optimization methods, that are explainable and transparent to decision makers
and stakeholders alike. I also have a deep interest in developing user
interfaces, and the user experience in general from a cognition perspective. 

I am also a main contributor and maintainer of DESDEO. DESDEO is an open-source
Python and TypeScript full-stack framework for interactive multiobjective
optimization. It includes a backend containing algorithmic implementations of
various interactive multiobjective optimization methods, both multi-criteria
decision-making methods and stochastic evolutionary methods; a web application
programming interface (API) with database and user session management to connect
the backend over the web to existing and custom interfaces; and a frontend, a
graphical web-based interface. The web-API and web-GUI are still under
development. DESDEO is fueled by our group's decades of collective experience in
researching and developing multiobjective optimization methods.

DESDEO can offer huge opportunities for academics and industry for tackling
data-based problems with multiple and conflicting objective functions to be
either minimized or maximized. DESDEO can very much function as the connecting
piece between all the fancy AI tools available these days, and making actual
decisions based on the tools' output.

In the documentation, there is also a primer on what multiobjective optimization is,
